See the full [usage documentation](https://xsrv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html).

`xsrv` uses [ansible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_%28software%29), a [configuration management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_configuration_management) system for reproducible and automated deployments, configuration and change management. You can use the provided command-line tool to manage your setup, or [include the roles in your own ansible playbooks](https://xsrv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#using-as-ansible-collection).
